Popular weather apps may show the air quality at one location in the city:

+ **[Gov of Canada](https://weather.gc.ca/airquality/pages/abaq-002_e.html/)**
    + includes forecast

These show air quality readings from all around the city:

+   **[AQICN](https://aqicn.org/city/canada/alberta/calgary-central-2/)**
    +  updated every 5 mins
+   **[IQAir](https://www.iqair.com/ca/)**
    +  updated once an hour; includes visual wind direction (useful to see what may be coming your way)

This visually shows the location of forest fires and smoke:

+ **[Fire Smoke](https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current//)**
