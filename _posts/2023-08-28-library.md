The **[Calgary Public Library](https://calgarylibrary.ca/)** has tonnes of free stuff.  Did you know they have freemium printing, bookable meeting rooms, movies, Libby, Rosetta Stone, in person programs, and much more (like books).

Ex:

- **[CPL - Digital Library](https://calgarylibrary.ca/read-learn-and-explore/digital-library/)**
- **[CPL - Book a Meeting Room](https://calgarylibrary.ca/events-and-programs/book-a-space/)**
- **[CPL - Freemium Printing](https://calgarylibrary.ca/your-library/free-services/printing/)**


Tip:
- Check months ahead for movie titles.  Try to put a hold on them when they get entered in the system so your wait time is only a few weeks versus months.
- To see upcoming release, see [tribute.ca](https://www.tribute.ca/movies/dvd/coming-soon/)
