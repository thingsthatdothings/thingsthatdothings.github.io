Months of planning are needed for a Disney Trip.  Have you started?

## DisneyWorld - Florida

### Flights
- there is a direct Westjet flight from YYC to MCO
- Westjet usually has Black Friday and Birthday Sales (Feb 28/29)
- Tip: the RBC Westjet Mastercard ($119) wil get you a round trip companion voucher for $119 and a free checked bag

### Hotel
- If you are taking advantage of the Disney Dining Plan, you'll need to stay at one of the DisneyWorld Resort properties.  It's not cheap, but you'll save about $57 to $95US for adults and $24 to $30US a day on food which makes up for some of the hotel price differences.
- The Deluxe Resorts will get you the full Disney Dining Plan (including table service meals)
- The Moderate and Value Resorts will get you Disney Quick Service Plan (cafeteria-style or counter-service venues)

- If you're not on the Disney Dining Plan, check out the [Disneyworld special offers page](https://.disney.go.com/en_CA/special-offers/) or check sites like [AMA Travel](https://www.amatravel.ca/)
- If staying offsite, ensure the hotel has frequent shuttles to the parks

### Ground Transportation
- How to get from the airport to your hotel?
- [MEARS Connect bus](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_CA/faq/transportation/airport-transportation/)
- $13-$16, no surge pricing

### Park Passes
- If you are taking advantage of the Disney Dining Plan, the park hopper tickets are included with hotel.

- If you're not on the Disney Dining Plan, check out the [Disneyworld special offers page](https://.disney.go.com/en_CA/special-offers/) or check sites like [AMA Travel](https://www.amatravel.ca/vacation-packages/theme-parks)

- Ask yourself, do I really need the park hopper?
    - There's lots to do and see in one park.
    - Taking a shuttle bus between parks is time consuming.
