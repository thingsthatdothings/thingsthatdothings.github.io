The extra $10 gift card will need to be used at London Drugs. You can use the Anycard on one of the designated vendors.  Works out to 20% off.

Looks like you have to create an account at Anycard, then choose a vendor to get their specific e-card.

Note: Walmart may have a similar deal starting Feb 8th, so if a Walmart gift card works better for you than a London Drugs gift card, wait til then.
