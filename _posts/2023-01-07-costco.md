Do you have a love/hate relationship with Costco?  Love the deals but hate not knowing what's on sale every week until you get there?

Well, check out cocowest every Tuesday to see what's on sale in Vancouver BC - most things are the same price in Alberta (sometimes).

Note: 
+ Don't bother going to the above site on Mondays - there is a paywall.  

If you have to go to Costco on a Monday, this RFD'er sometimes posts on Mondays:

Good-luck!
