Let's face it, if thieves really want to steal your car, they will.

If you ever had to make a police report for a stolen car, some of the first few questions they ask are:
- make
- model
- colour
- any identifying marks

Maybe, just maybe, if there were bright custom vinyl shapes or images on the car, would the thieves take the car in the first place?

Google "car vinyl" and see how much it would cost to buy some "stickers" for your car.

Vinyl might not save your car from being stolen, but depending on your vinyl choice, the car might look cooler, and if you forgot where you parked, it might be easier to spot your car in a crowded parking lot.
