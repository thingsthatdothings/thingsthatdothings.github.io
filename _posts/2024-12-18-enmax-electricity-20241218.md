If you're with Enmax, consider renewing your contract at the lower rate.  

It takes a few seconds to renew, log in and go to: Manage My Plan.

Note: EasyMax Loyalty Dual Fuel users may see the rate decrease even further (8.59c/kWh)? YMMV.

Natural Gas stayed the same at $4.59/KJ on the fixed rate.
