Last year, trees were all snapped up in seconds.  Fast fingers!

## 2024 Registration Dates:
- ~~N.E. Calgary registration opens Monday, April 22 at 10 a.m.~~
- ~~S.E. Calgary registration opens Monday, April 29 at 10 a.m.~~
- ~~N.W. Calgary registration opens Monday, May 6 at 10 a.m.~~
- S.W. Calgary registration opens Monday, May 13 at 10 a.m.

## Important to note:

- This program is extremely popular. Trees are provided on a first come, first served basis and will likely go very quickly once registration opens.
- This year we have 5000 trees to provide. Due to the popularity of the program, we will only accept and process one tree application per address and applications do not guarantee receiving a tree.
- When filling out the application form, you will be able to request 3 choices for the type of tree you would like and will receive one of your 3 choices.
- The tree requested as part of an application may be substituted for a similar tree and the exact tree provided will depend on our tree supplierâ€™s stock.
- Once we have approximately received more applications than trees available in each quadrant the form will no longer be accessible. There will be no waitlist once all the trees are taken.
- Further information on tree pick-up dates and locations will be provided at a later date by email to successful applicants.
