If you're with Enmax, the electricity rates went down, consider renewing your contract at the lower rate.  

It takes a few seconds to renew, log in and go to: Manage My Plan.

Note: EasyMax Loyalty Dual Fuel users may see the rate decrease even further (9.29c/kWh)?

Natural Gas also went down to $4.59/KJ on the fixed rate.
