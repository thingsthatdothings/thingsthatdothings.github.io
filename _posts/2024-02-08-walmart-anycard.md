The extra $10 gift card will need to be used at Walmart. You can use the Anycard on one of the designated vendors.  Works out to 20% off.

Steps:
- Buy $50 Anycard at Walmart - make sure to keep the receipt - you'll need it!
- Create an [Anycard](https://www.anycard.ca/choice/) account if you don't already have one
- Add the gift card to your Anycard account (use the secret card id inside the gift card flap)
- Select the vendor you want to redeem your Anycard funds to (it will email the gift vendor card to you)
- get your bonus $10 Walmart gift card by going to https://getmybonus.ca/ and enter the card number from the very top of the Walmart receipt. Note: don't use the card number on the actual gift card, use the card number from the Walmart receipt - that's how it makes the connection that you bought the card from Walmart.  You will be emailed the $10 Walmart gift card.  You must claim your Bonus $10 Walmart eGift Card by March 1, 2024.

Looks like you can only claim (1) Walmart eGift Card.
