Notes:
- scholarship info changes often,so check the site for more accurate info.
- create a spreadsheet, watch the deadlines
- many Scholarships ask for essays - if you are tempted to use ChatGPT, generate a few times, pick out the best parts, and change it up, take out flourishy words that you would normally would not use, make it unique "-ish", and specific to you before submitting
