Want a snack/treat at a fraction of the original price? (1/2 off or higher)
Want to save good food from going to waste?

Leftovers that businesses could not sell, but 'should' still be good to eat:

Some images of what may be in the surprise bags which change daily:
* [TooGoodToGo pics from Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooGoodToGoCanada/)

Note:
- this needs the mobile app and a credit/debit card
- it seems random that some people get the buy 9 and the 10th free offer, some don't
- Timmies
    - usually 6-7 baked goods (like a muffin, savory twist, croissant, or bagel)
    - some online images show the possibility of 12 donuts, this is rare, but fits the 1/3 the original price scheme
- 7-Eleven
    - usually 6-13 donuts/muffins/croissants
- other
    - YMMV
