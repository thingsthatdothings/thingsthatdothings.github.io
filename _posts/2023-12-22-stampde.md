The streets are overflowing with free stuff during the Calgary Stampede.

+ Check sites for free breakfasts
    - **[stampedebreakfast.ca](https://stampedebreakfast.ca/)**
        - bring tupperware!
        - Pancakes in Olympic Plaza almost every morning during Stampede
        - early 7am birds to the Chinook breakfast on the first Saturday not only get the worm, but no line ups as well!

+ Check the Calgary Stampede site for value days on the grounds
    - **[calgarystampede.com](https://www.calgarystampede.com/)**
        - usually first Sunday morning is free to get in (then stamp your hand and come back in the evening)
        - there's usually a kids and seniors day where the morning has free entry
