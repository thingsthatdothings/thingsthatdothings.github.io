What are the really good deals in this week flyers?

Below are few deals from ([PurpleGeek](https://www.reddit.com/user/PurpleGeek/)) and a few others ...

## Real Canadian Superstore:
- Gala apples (5lb): $4.85 &#128077;

- Rogers sugar (4kg): $4.99 &#128077;
- Tamam chickpeas or red kidney beans (796ml): $1.49. The ad says that these are 740ml but the picture shows 796ml. It’s not clear if these have been shrinkflationed, or if this is an error in the flyer.

## No Frills:
- Boneless skinless chicken breasts: $5.99/lb (while quantities last)

## Walmart:
- Ambrosia apples: $0.97/lb
- Russet potatoes (10lb): $2.77 &#128077;
- Redpath sugar (2kg): $2.77 (pretty good, Superstore is better if you can use 4kg)

## Safeway / Sobeys:
- Kraft dinner (12-pack): $9.97, buy 2 get 200pts. This effectively makes them $8.97, or about $0.75/box if you buy 2 packs.
- Rogers brown, yellow or icing sugar (1kg): $1.99 &#128077;

## FreshCo:
- Mandarins (4lb): $5.97
- Hot house tomatoes: $0.97/lb &#128077;
- Nestle Halloween candy: Spend $20, get 500pts. Buy a 100 count box + a 50 count box. They work out to $16.94, which is pretty good, and seems to be the best option for chocolate if you don’t yet have anything for the trick-or-treaters.
- Honeydew melon: $4.97, buy 1 get 50pts, effectively making them $4.47ea
- Iceberg lettuce: $2.47, buy 1 get 50pts, effectively making them $1.97ea &#128077;

- Tri-colored peppers (3-pack): $4.99 + 20% bonus cash effectively making them $3.99. How good a deal this is depends a lot on how large the peppers are. Superstore is likely better with their $5.00 bags of naturally imperfect ones.
