Got a bike?  Is it registered with the police?

Did you know your bike has a unique serial number?  If your bike gets stolen, then recovered, it might be possible to have the bike returned to you (if the serial number isn't filed off).

Register and pick up a sticker.  A visible deterrent for thieves.

Or, are you purchasing a "used" bike?  Check the index database to see if it was stolen first.
