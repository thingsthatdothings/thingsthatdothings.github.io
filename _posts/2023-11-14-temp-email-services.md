Do you need an email to sign up for something but don't want the spam?

Use a temp email account that self expires, and does not need an account to create.

+ **[Ex: Temp Email Address (via mailmodo)](https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/temporary-email-address/)**

    - [temp-mail](https://temp-mail.org/en/)
        - self-destructed after 10 minutes
    - [guerrillamail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/)
        - emails are deleted within an hour
        - mail id stays active
    - [10minutemail](https://10minutemail.com/)
        - the address and its inbox content self-destruct after 10minutes
    - [emailondeck](https://www.emailondeck.com/)
        - deleted within a few hours
    - [yopmail](https://yopmail.com/en/)
        - All messages are kept for 8 days
        - mail id stays active
    - [throwawaymail](https://www.throwawaymail.com/en)
        - email that is self-destructed after 48 hours

Tip:
- Online stores are catching on to these temp email sites by not sending a discount code for up to 48hours.  Check out services like YOPMail which keeps the email address alive indefinitely and requires no account setup.
