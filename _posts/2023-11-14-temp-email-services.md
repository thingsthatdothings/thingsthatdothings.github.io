Do you need an email to sign up for something but don't want the spam?

Use a temp email account that self expires, and does not need an account to create.

Tip:
- Online stores are catching on to these temp email sites by not sending a discount code for up to 48hours.  Check out services like YOPMail which keeps the email address alive indefinitely and requires no account setup.
