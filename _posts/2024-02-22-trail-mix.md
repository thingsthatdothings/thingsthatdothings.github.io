Trail mix is healthy, but expensive.  Superstore sells a couple of the Basse trail mixes at 600g for $5.50.  

Usually found by the bulk bins with a big $5.50 sign.
Various varieties.  Only a few are under $1/100g.

Sometimes, there is PC offer to buy an amount to get points back, well if you need something to get to get you to that amount, this might work.
