New Crumbl Cookies in Deerfoot Meadows opens at 8am on Friday May 31, 2024.

The store is offering free semi-sweet chocolate chunk cookies all day, and they will be open until midnight. YMMV.

During the grand opening there will be a chance to spin the wheel for free merchandise, and children 12 years and younger can join a colouring contest, three of whom will win free cookies every week for a month.

Date: Friday May 31, 2024, 8am-midnight
Location: 840-8180 11 ST SE
