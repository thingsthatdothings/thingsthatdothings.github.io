Michaels has their coveted 50% off one regular priced item coupon available.

You can use it once per day, but if you need to get more than 1 item, go again the next day.  Or, bring a friend to do a separate transaction.

If you can't think of anything to buy, there's always gorilla glue or crazy glue.  Always handy to have a non dried up tube around the house.
