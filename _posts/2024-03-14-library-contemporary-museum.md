The Contemporary Calgary Art Pass will give Library patrons free access to visit Contemporary Calgary as often as they would like over a three-week loan period.

Check out the Art Pass book from any Library locations. Take the book to Contemporary Calgary to get free access to the gallery. There will also be a digital version available on [Libby](https://calgarylibrary.ca/read-learn-and-explore/digital-library/libby/).
