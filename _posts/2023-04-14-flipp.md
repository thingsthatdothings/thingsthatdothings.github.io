See the weekly flyers to plan your shopping.

The major grocery chains usually start new sales on Thursdays.

See **[Flipp](https://flipp.com/)** for preview and current flyers.

Notes:
- take pictures as a grocery list
- some stores do price matching if you show the ad (Ex: Superstore)
- the app has a handy search feature
