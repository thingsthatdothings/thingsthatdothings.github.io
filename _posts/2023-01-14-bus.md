Ok, so you're standing out in the cold, waiting for the bus, and the bus is late ... Where the @#!% is the bus?

## Real Time Bus Info

See where the bus is in real time (within a minute or two):

+ **[Transit55](https://transit55.ca/calgary/map/)**

Tip:
+  To cut down on mobile data, search for your specific transit bus route(s) and book mark the page!

## Calgary Transit Pocket Schedules

When in doubt, fall back to the good ol' transit schedules.

These are sometimes hard to find if you just do a google search. Instead, try this:

+ **[calgarytransit.com](https://www.calgarytransit.com/)**
    - click on Schedules/Maps
    - Enter your bus number in the "Select a route number" box
    - don't click on the big button presented, instead look underneath it for the "Download Pocket Schedule" link
    - save file to your phone

Note:
+ There are seasonal service changes, so check back once in awhile to see if your route has changed.
