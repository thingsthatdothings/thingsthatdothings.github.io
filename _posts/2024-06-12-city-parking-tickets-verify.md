Before you pay it, make sure its not a fake ticket.

The URL on the ticket should read: calgaryparking.com/tickets or parkingtickets.calgaryparking.com

Verify it by calling the CPA at 403-537-7000 with the number printed on it or check it using the agency's [official website](https://parkingtickets.calgaryparking.com/)
